### Static analysis with ESLint

We use ESLint for static analysis of our code. This tutorial shows how to setup ESLint in Visual Studio Code: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
During the configuration of ESLint several prompts are to answer. Please use the following answers:

#### Which framework does your project use?

✔ React

Vue.js

None of these

#### Where does your code run?

✔ Browser

Node

#### How would you like to define a style for your project?

✔ Use a popular style guide

Answer questions about your style

Inspect your JavaScript file(s)

-> Choose the Google Standard

### Testing with Jest

Since you have already npm installed, simply start the test jest test suite by calling npm test. The same tests are running in our gitlab pipeline.
